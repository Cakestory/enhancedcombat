# Enhanced Combat

Tweaks, adjustments and enhancements to the vanilla Minecraft´s combat experience.
Dual wielding of weapons, attack range, attack width, cooldown and critical hit settings and even more features.

This mod is a fork of SanAndreasP´s "BetterCombatRebirth" mod, which itself is a continuation of the original "BetterCombatMod" by Ironfists.
Most of the code was taken from Better Combat Rebirth´s GitHub page. The project´s code was then altered and extended by Cakestory.
